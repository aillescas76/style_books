![A backdrop inspired by the look and feel of Ancient Egypt, detailed with a fusion of steampunk elements. Picture traditional hieroglyphs brushed onto sunbaked papyrus, the tan backdrop crowded with shapes of divine deities and powerful pharaohs. Interspersed within these ancient tales, envision a steampunk influence: gears and cogs, ornate brass mechanisms, and pipe systems. The blend creates an unearthly harmony of old and new, as if an ancient civilization had a vision of a future filled with industry and elaborate machines.](./steam_egypt_11.png)
