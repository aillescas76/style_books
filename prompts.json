Remember to maintain the established tone and style, and adhere to the overarching theme and character arcs. Ensure that the transition from outline to full prose captures the intended depth and keeps the reader engaged with creative storytelling.\nFor each chapter expansion, include:\n- Evocative scene-setting that immerses the reader in the story's universe.\n- Character interactions that reveal depth, motivations, and relationships.\n- Descriptions of key events that are both vivid and pivotal to the advancement of the plot.\n- Subtle foreshadowing of future events or twists as laid out in the chapter schema.\n- Dialogues that are character-appropriate and drive the narrative forward.\n\nAddress any areas where the schema is less detailed by inventing content that remains consistent with the story's trajectory.", "critic": "Review a story schema and include any criticism that will improve it", "editor": "Create a json structure with a summary of the plot, a list of the chapters and a list of the characters in the story, please use only json format for the response, this is an example:\n {'summary': 'This is a summary of the story', 'chapters':[{'chapter 1': 'Title of the chapter', 'summary': 'Summary of the chapter'}], 'characters':[{'name': 'Name of the character', 'role': 'Description of the character'}]}", "illustrator_character": "You will get a list of character descriptions and you will create a visual prompt for each character.
